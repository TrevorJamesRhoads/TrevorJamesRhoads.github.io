                <h2>FADE IN.</h2>
                <h2>EXT. DOGGERLAND -- MORNING</h2>
                <p>A spear-wielding KHARI (55 M) walks among a lichen-riddled plain. The trees are spindly, gnarled things, with naught adorning their branches. Mostly there is small shrubbery nearby moss-covered boulders.</p>
                <p>The year is 19,000 B.C. This pre-historic world is recovering from its last ice age.</p>
                <p>Khari's breathe is a silvery wisp upon his lips. He watches the strange smoke fade into the Aether.</p>
                <p>Khari winces. Checks his hand. There is a nasty cut on his palm that is surrounded by a macabre yellow bruise. Puss is oozing from the laceration. He scrapes the ooze onto his clothes. The hunter crouches as he crests a hill.</p>
                <p>He allows himself a grin.</p>
                <p>Far bellow are three grazing creatures. They are equestrianand bovine-adjacent, but truly neither.</p>
                <p>He places his injured hand around the shaft of the longspear. He raises the weapon above his shoulder. It is ready to be projected when the moment is just right. He winces again. Bites his lip.</p>
                <p>He crests the hill...</p>
                <p>The creatures are yet grazing...</p>
                <p>He jumps forward, throwing the spear at the nearest animal.</p>
                <p>It goes just right.</p>
                <p>The creatures gallop away.</p>
                <p>Khari fights off tears. Looks to his hand.</p>
                <p>His palm has been torn open. His exposed flesh is green and black.</p>
                <h3>KHARI</h3> 
                <p>Cavi fuck me.</p>
                <p>TITLE CARD: "DOGGERLAND"</p>
                <p></p>Haunting Norse music.</p>
                <h2>EXT. CAMP -- NIGHT</h2>
                <p>Before a large tent made of mammoth hide burns a fire. A large cauldron is boiling above it.</p>
                <p>KIARA (19 F) places another log onto the fire. She takes in the smell of the boiling soup.</p>
                <p>From the background comes a limping Khari, carrying a haul of three rabbits. Kiara runs to check on her father.</p>
                <p>KHARI
                <p>Skin. Cook. Stew.</p>
                <p>KIARA 
                <p>Yes, father. Timely arrival, truly. The pot is already boiling
                <p>Khari grunts. Hands off the rabbits.</p>
                <p>She weighs them in her hands. Frowns.</p>
                <p>KIARA (CONT'D) Bit light aren't they?</p>
                <p>KHARI</p>
                <p>(Walking away.)</p>
                <p>'Twhy I said "stew." Khari enters the tent.</p>
                <h2>INT. TENT</h2>
                <p>In the corner of the room lays ISAK (14 M). His legs are noticeably under-developed. He turns, happy to see his father.</p>
                <p>ISAK Caribou?!</p>
                <p>Khari takes a moment to respond:</p>
                <p>KHARI No.</p>
                <p>He takes a seat. Removes his boots.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>One of Khari's leggings is ripped below the knee. The fabric is now wrapped around his injured hand.</p>
                <p>ISAK Horse-cow?</p>
                <p>KHARI</p>
                <p>(Still undressing.) Hare, child. No need to wonder.</p>
                <p>ISAK Oh. Well. I like hare, too.</p>
                <p>Khari changes into a lighter wardrobe.</p>
                <p>He looks to Isak before leaving:</p>
                <p>KHARI</p>
                <p>I'll have your sister get you when the food is prepared.</p>
                <h2>EXT. CAMP -- NIGHT</h2>
                <p>Khari passes by Kiara, busy skinning rabbits, and warms himself by the fire.</p>
                <p>KHARI They're migrating.</p>
                <p>The sounds of slicing stops.</p>
                <p>KIARA The hare?</p>
                <p>Khari frowns.</p>
                <p>KHARI The larger fauna.</p>
                <p>(Beat.) Why not ask me for clarification?</p>
                <p>What is with the guessing?</p>
                <p>Kiara doesn't reply to the question.</p>
                <p>KIARA Which direction?</p>
                <p>KHARI South.</p>
                <p>KIARA To the domain of fire.</p>
                <p>Khari leers at his daughter in the fire-light.</p>
                <p>KHARI Away, yes. To the pagans.</p>
                <h2>EXT. PLAINS - DAY</h2>
                <p>KHARI (50s M) is a grizzled hunter dressed in furs and leather. He wields a javelin. Adorned to his back is both a shortbow and a quiver of arrows.</p>
                <p>He looks up the ridge of lichen-covered rocks before him and squints. The sun is rising over the woods.</p>
                <p>Ascending the ridge, he nearly slips but catches himself on a boulder. His fingernails dig into the lichen that coats it. <u>EXT. FOREST - DAY</u></p>
                <p>Khari stalks through a forest. The trees are spindly, gnarled things, severely outnumbered by lesser shrubbery and moss-covered stumps and rocks. At the sound of a singing bird, Khari pauses.</p>
                <p>He studies his surroundings. He looks to the trees. There are no birds; indeed, there is no wildlife at all. <u>EXT. FOREST - DAY </u>A stag is grazing.</p>
                <p>Khari sets down his javelin and procures his bow.</p>
                <p>He nocks a bonetip arrow. Aims...</p>
                <p>A songbird chirps just behind him, startling both Khari and the stag. An arrow goes into the deer's hind as it jumps away into the woods. Khari sits down at the base of a tree. Curses his luck.</p>
                <p>He looks up, attempting to find the bird that had costed him his prey, but it is nowhere to be seen. At the boughs--</p>
                <p>KHARI Sing to me again.</p>
                <p>There is no response to the threat.</p>
                <p>KHARI (CONT'D) Very well.</p>
                <p>Khari stands.</p>
                <p><u>EXT. FOREST - DAY </u>Khari follows a trail of blood.</p>
                <p>A chorus of birds can be heard.</p>
                <p>Khari warily follows their song.</p>
                <p>The choral music ceases as Khari stumbles upon--</p>
                <p>--a vulture pecking at the fallen stag's stomach, innards and organs splayed forth. Khari approaches. Waves the vulture away.</p>
                <p>KHARI Get!</p>
                <p>The vulture turns its head to him, quizical.</p>
                <p>KHARI (CONT'D) Get! Filth!</p>
                <p>The vulture tilts its head, confused by this creature, then continues eating at stomach of the stag. Khari kicks at the vulture, but it doesn't seem preturbed.</p>
                <p>Khari grabs the bird by its long neck and twists. There is a devestating crunch. Khari throws the dead bird away from the stag.</p>
                <p>Khari kneels down by the deer. It is still alive.</p>
                <p>KHARI (CONT'D) I am sorry. So unclean.</p>
                <p>As Khari reaches for his javelin, the stag <em>jolts up</em>, lucid.</p>
                <p>It gores Khari with its antlers, before limping into the woods, blood pouring from its stomach. Khari grabs his stomach. He is bleeding profusely.</p>
                <p>Light-headed, Khari leans back and lays down on the forest floor. Beside him is the vulture, neck twisted, with its dead eyes staring at him. Khari is rapidly losing consciousness.</p>
                <h2>KHARI (CONT'D)</h2>
                <p>(To the vulture.)</p>
                <p>Could it have been you...with a song so sweet?</p>
                <p><u>EXT. DOGGERLAND - DAY </u>A bird's-eye view of the forest.</p>
                <p>We once again hear the chorus of syrens.</p>
                <p>Super: DOGGERLAND Time-lapse into night.</p>
                <p>The chorus devolves into cacophonous, maniacle laughter.</p>
                <h2>EXT. CAMP - NIGHT</h2>
                <p>Isak looks sadly into the campfire. Disformed, fragile feet dangle from the log he sits upon.</p>
                <p>Kiara stands before the fire, stirring the large cauldron with a ladle.</p>
                <p>KIARA Don't pout. Father will return.</p>
                <p>Until then we have soup. Smell the lentils.</p>
                <p>ISAK They smell of earth.</p>
                <p>Kiara grins.</p>
                <p>KIARA</p>
                <p>You will never guess from where I plucked them.</p>
                <p>ISAK Hel?</p>
                <p>KIARA You jest about the wrong things.</p>
                <p>ISAK It's just Hel.</p>
                <p>Kiara frowns.</p>
                <p>KIARA This is what I mean.</p>
                <p>ISAK</p>
                <p>If something can be made fun of, then it has no power of you.</p>
                <p>KIARA Yes--well--I'm not sure I agree.</p>
                <p>Kiara takes in the smell of the lentil soup.</p>
                <p>ISAK</p>
                <p>We can chop off my legs for stew meat if needs must.</p>
                <p>KIARA Sure. Yes. Let's.</p>
                <p>(Beat.)</p>
                <p>We can go toe by toe. Save the rest for later.</p>
                <p>Isak raises his brow at his sister, laughs.</p>
                <p>ISAK</p>
                <p>Now you're getting it, sister. Do you think we'll move back to town now?</p>
                <p>Kiara sits next to her brother. Lays down the ladle.</p>
                <p>KIARA We can't.</p>
                <p>ISAK</p>
                <p>There's no food here. Our plants barely grow, and the game moves south.</p>
                <p>KIARA</p>
                <p>No doubt those in Soma are experiencing the same.</p>
                <p>Isak sighs.</p>
                <p>ISAK</p>
                <p>Then let's all follow the game south.</p>
                <p>KIARA All?</p>
                <p>ISAK</p>
                <p>It's clever, you see. Father is exiled from Soma, <em>not </em>from anywhere else.</p>
                <p>KIARA</p>
                <p>You forget, south is the Moon Drinkers.</p>
                <p>Isak looks around, as if the gods themselves might hear him.</p>
                <p>ISAK</p>
                <p>(Whispering.)</p>
                <p>Alright. But what does that even mean?</p>
                <p>KIARA</p>
                <p>I--</p>
                <p>ISAK Have you ever met one?</p>
                <p>Kiara rolls her eyes.</p>
                <p>KIARA No.</p>
                <p>ISAK The deer go south. As do the hare.</p>
                <p><em>As do the birds!</em></p>
                <p>KIARA Father will never hear of it.</p>
                <p>ISAK He should reconsider.</p>
                <p>Kiara chuckles. She pats Isak on the head, grabs the ladle and continues tending to the soup. <u>EXT. CAMP - NIGHT</u></p>
                <p>Khari enters from the woods. In one hand is the vulture, with the other he uses his javelin like a walking stick. Kiara jumps to her feet, runs to her father.</p>
                <p>She goes to embrace him, but Khari holds up the vulture between them.</p>
                <p>KHARI Flay the fowl.</p>
                <p>Kiara grimaces but takes the disgusting bird.</p>
                <p>Isak leans forward, attempting to get a better look.</p>
                <p>ISAK What is it? A hare?</p>
                <p>Khari passes his son by.</p>
                <p>KHARI Nothing so fecund.</p>
                <p>Then he enters the tent.</p>
                <p><u>INT. TENT - NIGHT </u>Khari undresses. His stomach wound is grave.</p>
                <h2>INT. TENT - NIGHT</h2>
                <p>The tent is large but mostly unfurnished. Each family members has a chair and a cot, around a hearth. The three of them eat bird soup before a small fire.</p>
                <p>ISAK</p>
                <p>A vulture. Funny. I just don't know if it's ironic or not.</p>
                <p>KHARI None of this "irony" business.</p>
                <p>ISAK</p>
                <p>But father, the vulture is a omen of--</p>
                <p>KHARI I grow tired of it, child.</p>
                <p>(Beat.) Kiara, how fare the crops?</p>
                <p>KIARA</p>
                <p>The blight has claimed all but the south quadrant. I do not have high hopes for final harvest...</p>
                <p>KHARI No.</p>
                <p>He sets his bowl down.</p>
                <h2>KHARI (CONT'D)</h2>
                <p>The choice has never been more obvious. I must enter the Forbidden Wood, like my father before me, in an attempt to find salvation.</p>
                <p>ISAK&nbsp;&nbsp; KIARA He died. He never came back.</p>
                <p>Khari nods.</p>
                <h2>KHARI</h2>
                <p>But I shall return, a stag tied to my back.</p>
                <p>KIARA You would give up?</p>
                <p>Khari is displeased.</p>
                <h2>KHARI</h2>
                <p>Give up? This is the only hope that remains.</p>
                <p>ISAK</p>
                <p>Not if we go south--</p>
                <h2>KHARI</h2>
                <p>(Clenching his jaw.) I <em>am </em>going south.</p>
                <p>ISAK Beyond! Past the Forbidden Wood. Don't you wish to know where all the critters are going?</p>
                <p>KHARI The south is accursed.</p>
                <p>ISAK Says who?</p>
                <h2>KHARI</h2>
                <p>Silence, child. Lest I rend your arms to match your legs.</p>
                <p>KIARA Father!</p>
                <p>KHARI I will not be vexed by children.</p>
                <p>He stands.</p>
                <h2>KHARI (CONT'D)</h2>
                <p>I hunt on the morrow! And the Sun God will light my path.</p>
                <p>He leaves the tent.</p>
                <p>Kiara frowns, looks to her brother.</p>
                <p>KIARA Are you done?</p>
                <p>Isak looks down at his bowl.</p>
                <p>ISAK Yeah.</p>
                <p><u>EXT. CAMP - NIGHT </u>Khari is building a fire. It is an arduous task.</p>
                <h2>EXT. CAMP - NIGHT</h2>
                <p>On the far side on the now raging fire, Khari is sharpening branches into javelins. Near the tent, Kiara washes bowls and spoons in a basin.</p>
                <p>Kiara looks to her father through the flames. When Khari raises his head, she swiftly looks away. <u>INT. CAMP - NIGHT </u>Khari kicks at the coals of the dying fire.</p>
                <p>Kiara is leaning against the tent. Melancholic.</p>
                <p>Khari turns toward her.</p>
                <p>KHARI Bed down for the night.</p>
                <p>Kiara doesn't respond but obeys her father.</p>
                <p>Before she opens the flap--</p>
                <h2>KHARI (CONT'D)</h2>
                <p>(Earnestly.) The bird soup. You did your best.</p>
                <p>Kiara enters.</p>
                <p>Khari frowns, stamps out the last of the flames.</p>
                <p><u>INT. TENT - NIGHT </u>The hearth is a cauldron of smoking ash.</p>
                <p>Khari is snoring.</p>
                <p>Kiara's eyes are wide open.</p>
                <p>She slowly gets up. Looks to her brother.</p>
                <p>Isak is sleeping soundly.</p>

                <p><u>EXT. CAMP - NIGHT </u>Kiara exits the tent to a dark, foreboding landscape.</p>
                <p>She wraps a fur coat around herself, then heads off into the woods. <u>INT. TENT - DAY </u>Isak is shaken awake by his father.</p>
                <p>KHARI Your sister. Where is she?</p>
                <p>Isak wipes his sleepy eyes. He doesn't understand.</p>
                <p>Khari wraps Isak's tunic around his fist.</p>
                <p>KHARI (CONT'D) Where has she gone?</p>
                <p>Isak grabs at his throat. Khari frowns at his curled first, releases his son.</p>

                <p>KHARI She took a javelin.</p>
                <h2>EXT. CAMP - DAY</h2>
                <p>Khari looks around the ground but can't find any footprints on the dry earth.</p>
                <p>But, upon further review, Khari sees a trail of what must be a javelin being used as a walking stick. He mumbles to himself. <u>EXT. CAMP - DAY</u></p>
                <p>Khari digs into harsh earth with a spade nearby a small tree.</p>
                <p><u>INT. TENT - DAY </u>Khari sets a small chest in front of Isak.</p>

                <h2>(Studying the dagger.)</h2>
                <p>There is no one left to use it. But me.</p>
                <p>(Beat.) I should come with you.</p>
                <p>KHARI No.</p>
                <p>ISAK And if I use this dagger on myself?</p>
                <p>KHARI Quiet.</p>
                <h2>ISAK</h2>
                <p>You would only have to hunt for two--</p>
                <p>Khari's anger flares, then resigns to sadness--</p>
                <h2>KHARI</h2>
                <p>The man that gives up on life is cursed to repeat it.</p>
                <p>ISAK I'm just a boy, though; not a man.</p>
                <p>Maybe I could kill my--</p>
                <h2>KHARI</h2>
                <p>Enough. I will not suffer a melancholic.</p>
                <p>Khari closes his eyes.</p>
                <h2>KHARI (CONT'D)</h2>
                <p>In an already harsh world, you have been disadvantaged. I cannot...I cannot relate to your pain.</p>
                <p>ISAK It's not pain. It's numbness.</p>
                <p>Khari can relate to that.</p>
                <p>KHARI Aye. Alright.</p>
                <p>An awkward moment between father and son.</p>
                <p>KHARI (CONT'D) I'll return.</p>
                <p>ISAK Stag tied to your back?</p>
                <p>Khari allows a smile.</p>
                <p>KHARI Solis will not fail me.</p>
                <p>ISAK It's not always about the gods.</p>
                <p>Solis may fail you, father, but do not fail yourself.</p>
                <p>KHARI</p>
                <p>Very well. Make sure I have something to come back to.</p>
                <p><u>EXT. FOREST - DAY </u>Kiara is sleeping at the roots of a tree.</p>
                <p>Crinkling leaves wake her.</p>
                <p>She grabs her javelin, peers around the tree to see a stag walking through the forest. Its intestines sag from its stomach, dragging against the ground. A large arrow protrudes from its hind.</p>
                <p>She watches, aghast, as the stag continues on, further into the forest.</p>
                <p>Kiara grabs her few belongings and heads off, veering away from the stag. <u>EXT. FOREST - DAY</u></p>
                <p>Khari walks into a treeline. The trunk of the largest tree has been carved into. It is a crescent moon that encircles a skull. <u>EXT. FOREST - DAY </u>The Forbidden Wood has taller, wider, healthier trees.</p>
                <p>Khari comes across a circle of toadstools. He is wary of such a landmark and keeps his distance. <u>EXT. FOREST - DAY</u></p>
                <p>Once again, Khari stumbles upon a familiar looking site: the circle of toadstools nearby a rotted tree.</p>
                <p>Khari scowls. Instead of moving forward, he turns back.</p>
                <h2>EXT. FOREST - DAY</h2>
                <p>Khari exits the treeline of the Forbidden Wood. To his right is the large tree with the moon and skull etched into it. Khari exhales, looks up toward the sun.</p>
                <p>KHARI</p>
                <p>(Whispering to the tree.) Alright...alright.</p>
                <h2>EXT. FOREST - DAY</h2>
                <p>The circle of toadstools lay before Khari. Reluctantly, he approaches it. He stabs his javelin into the center of the circle...</p>
                <p>Nothing happens.</p>
                <p>Khari thinks. He grabs a lichen-covered rock and tosses it into the circle... The lichen seemingly dissolves, leaving the rock bare.</p>
                <p>KHARI Curses, Ultima.</p>
                <p>Khari walks into the circle and promptly disappears, his clothes and weapons falling to the ground. </p>
